# NumericalAnalysis
The exercises on the [Numerical Analysis](http://math.ecnu.edu.cn/~jypan/Teaching/NA/refs/Numerical%20Analysis%202nd.Sauer.2012.pdf) realized by Python.<br>
<br>
Most of my work are based on python packages Numpy, random.
<br><br>
All py files are named in the following rules.<br>
